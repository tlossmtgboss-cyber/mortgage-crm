## What Happens After Sync

### 1. Email Processing Flow
```
Microsoft Inbox
    ↓
Sync to CRM (every 5 min)
    ↓
AI Email Processor Agent
    ↓
Data Extraction (loan info, dates, status)
    ↓
Reconciliation Queue (if confidence < 95%)
    ↓
Bulk Approval (up to 20 items)
    ↓
Loan Files Updated
```

### 2. Reconciliation Items Created

You'll see pending items for:

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Microsoft 365 not connected"

**Cause:** OAuth connection not completed

**Solution:**
1. Go to Settings → Integrations
2. Click "Outlook Email" card
3. Complete OAuth flow in popup
4. Check for "Connected" status

### Issue: "Sync failed - please try again"

**Possible causes:**
- Microsoft token expired → Will auto-refresh
- Network issue → Try again
- Invalid permissions → Reconnect Microsoft 365

**Solution:**
1. Check Settings → Integrations → Microsoft 365 status
2. If showing "Connected", click "Sync Now" to retry
3. If not connected, reconnect via OAuth flow

### Issue: No items in reconciliation queue after sync

**This is normal if:**
- ✅ No new emails since last sync
- ✅ No loan-related content in emails
- ✅ All extractions had 95%+ confidence (auto-applied)

**Check:**
- Last sync timestamp updated?
- Email count in sync message
- Loan files for auto-applied updates (high confidence)

### Issue: Popup blocked

**Solution:**
1. Allow popups for mortgage-crm domain
2. Click "Outlook Email" card again
3. Popup should appear
