# User Cleanup Script

This directory contains administrative scripts for managing the CRM system.

## cleanup_users.py

Deletes all users except those with `@cmgfi.com` email addresses.

### Usage

**Dry run (see what would be deleted without actually deleting):**
```bash
cd backend
export DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
python scripts/cleanup_users.py --dry-run
```

**Actual deletion (requires confirmation):**
```bash
cd backend
export DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
python scripts/cleanup_users.py
```

### What it does

1. Connects to the database
2. Finds all users without `@cmgfi.com` email addresses
3. Displays a list of users to be deleted
4. Shows count of users to keep vs. delete
5. Asks for confirmation (you must type `DELETE`)
6. Deletes the users
7. Shows remaining `@cmgfi.com` users

### Safety Features

- **Dry run mode**: Test without making changes
- **Confirmation required**: Must type `DELETE` to proceed
- **Clear reporting**: Shows exactly what will be deleted before proceeding
- **Database transactions**: Uses proper rollback on errors

### Example Output

### Database URL

Set your database URL as an environment variable:

**Local:**
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mortgage_crm"
```

**Railway Production:**
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@containers-us-west-123.railway.app:5432/railway"
```

**Or get from Railway CLI:**
```bash
railway variables
# Copy the DATABASE_URL value
export DATABASE_URL="<value-from-railway>"
```

### Safety Recommendations

1. **Always run with `--dry-run` first** to preview what will be deleted
2. **Backup your database** before running the script
3. **Verify the users to keep** by checking the remaining users list
4. **Run during off-hours** to avoid disrupting active users

### Troubleshooting

**Error: "DATABASE_URL environment variable not set"**
```bash
# Set the environment variable
export DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
```

**Error: "Email already registered" when creating new users**
- The cleanup script doesn't affect user creation
- Check if the email already exists in the database

**Script cancelled by user**
- Press Ctrl+C to cancel at any time
- No changes will be made if you cancel during confirmation
