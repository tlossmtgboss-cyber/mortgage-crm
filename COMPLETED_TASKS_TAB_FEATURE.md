## 📊 Completed Tasks Tab Features

### Task List (Left Panel)
Each completed task shows:
- **Contact names**: "Contact A → Contact B"
- **Completion date & time**: When the merge was completed
- **Fields merged**: Number of fields that were merged
- **AI accuracy badge**: 
  - 🟢 Green: 90%+ accuracy
  - 🟡 Yellow: 70-89% accuracy

## 🔧 Backend API Endpoints

### 1. GET /api/v1/merge/completed
**Purpose**: Fetch list of completed merges for review

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "completed_tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "completed_at": "2025-01-14T10:30:00Z",

### 2. POST /api/v1/merge/feedback
**Purpose**: Submit corrective feedback on a completed merge

**Request**:
```json
{
  "task_id": 1,
  "feedback": "The AI incorrectly chose the older phone number instead of the newer one."
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Feedback submitted successfully. This will help improve AI accuracy."
}
```

**Features**:
- Validates feedback is not empty
- Stores feedback in `user_decision` JSON field
- Timestamps when feedback was submitted
- Logs feedback submission for monitoring
- Can be used to retrain AI models in the future

## 💾 Database Storage

### Feedback Storage
Feedback is stored in the `duplicate_pairs` table:

```sql
-- user_decision JSON field structure after feedback:
{
  "name": 1,
  "email": 1,
  "phone": 2,
  ...
  "feedback": "The AI incorrectly chose the older phone number...",
  "feedback_at": "2025-01-14T10:35:00.000Z"
}
```

### Data Used
- `duplicate_pairs` table (status = 'merged' or 'auto_merged')
- `merge_training_events` table (calculates AI accuracy)
- `leads` table (gets contact names and details)
