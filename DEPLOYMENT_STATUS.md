## 🎯 How the AI Learning System Works

### Duplicate Detection
1. System scans leads for matching name/email/phone
2. Calculates similarity score (75%+ threshold)
3. Creates `duplicate_pairs` records
4. AI generates field-by-field suggestions

### AI Training Process
1. User reviews duplicates in Merge Center
2. Selects which fields to keep from each record
3. System compares user's choices to AI's predictions
4. Tracks which fields AI predicted correctly
5. Updates consecutive correct counter
6. **If all fields correct**: Increment streak
7. **If ANY field wrong**: Reset streak to 0

### Autopilot Unlock
- After **100 consecutive correct** predictions
- System unlocks auto-merge capability
- User still has manual override option

---

## 📊 System Capabilities

### Current Features Live in Production:

1. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Name similarity matching (40% weight)
   - Email exact matching (30% weight)
   - Phone number matching (30% weight)
   - 75% minimum similarity threshold

2. **AI Suggestions**
   - Heuristics-based initial recommendations
   - Confidence scoring (60-95%)
   - Learning from user's historical decisions
   - Field-specific prediction tracking

3. **Merge Execution**
   - Combines two leads into one
   - Deletes duplicate record
   - Preserves user's field choices
   - Updates principal record
   - Creates training events

4. **Training Analytics**
   - Total predictions made
   - Accuracy percentage
   - Consecutive correct streak
   - Progress to autopilot (X/100)
   - Last prediction timestamp

5. **Review Queue**
   - Stores complete merge history
   - Status tracking (pending/merged/dismissed)
   - Principal record ID preserved
   - User decision data saved
   - Timestamp records

## 🧪 Testing Available

### Documentation Created:
- ✅ `MERGE_SYSTEM_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Complete manual testing guide
- ✅ `test_merge_api.sh` - Shell script for API testing
- ✅ `test_merge_system.py` - Python automated tests

### Test Coverage:

## 🎉 Ready for Use!

### To Start Using:

1. **Login**: https://mortgage-crm-nine.vercel.app/login
2. **Navigate**: Click "Reconciliation" in top menu
3. **Test**: Create duplicate leads to see system in action
4. **Train**: Perform merges to train the AI
5. **Track**: Watch progress bar toward autopilot

### Sample Data:
- Click "⚙️ Settings" → "✨ Create 5 Sample Tasks"
- This creates test reconciliation tasks for demo
