## ⏳ PENDING TASKS

### 1. ⏳ Railway Deployment (IN PROGRESS - Automatic)

**Current status:**
- Code pushed to GitHub: ✅
- Railway detecting changes: 🔄 (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
- Railway building: ⏳ (pending)
- Railway deploying: ⏳ (pending)

**What happens automatically:**
1. Railway detects GitHub push
2. Railway pulls latest code
3. Railway installs dependencies (msal already in requirements.txt)
4. Railway restarts backend
5. New endpoints become available

**Expected completion:** 2-5 minutes from push time (pushed at current time)

**How to check:**
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your mortgage-crm project
3. Click backend service
4. Click "Deployments" tab
5. Look for latest deployment starting

---

### 2. ⏳ Azure AD Configuration (REQUIRES USER ACTION)

**This is the ONLY step you need to do manually!**

**What you need to do:**
1. Open Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com
2. Register a new app (takes 10 minutes)
3. Get 3 values:
   - Application (client) ID
   - Directory (tenant) ID
   - Client Secret
4. Set API permissions:
   - Calendars.ReadWrite
   - OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All
   - User.Read.All
5. Grant admin consent
6. Add 3 environment variables to Railway:
   - `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID`
   - `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID`

**Detailed instructions:** See `AZURE_AD_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

**Time required:** ~30 minutes (first time), ~10 minutes (if you've done it before)

---

## 🔍 TESTING THE SETUP

### Test 1: Check Railway Deployment

**Wait 5 minutes after git push, then run:**
```bash
python3 test_teams_integration.py
```

**Expected output if Railway deployed successfully:**
```
✅ Backend is healthy
✅ Authentication successful
✅ Teams Status Endpoint Working!

📋 Configuration Status:
   • MSAL Available: ✅
   • Client ID Set: ❌  (Expected - you haven't added variables yet)
   • Client Secret Set: ❌  (Expected)
   • Tenant ID Set: ❌  (Expected)
```

If you see `❌ Status check failed: {"detail":"Not Found"}`, Railway hasn't deployed yet. Wait 2 more minutes and try again.

---

### Test 2: After Azure AD Setup

**After adding environment variables to Railway, run:**
```bash
python3 test_teams_integration.py
```

**Expected output after full setup:**
```
✅ Backend is healthy
✅ Authentication successful
✅ Teams Status Endpoint Working!

📋 Configuration Status:
   • MSAL Available: ✅
   • Client ID Set: ✅
   • Client Secret Set: ✅
   • Tenant ID Set: ✅
   • Fully Configured: ✅

🎉 Teams integration is READY TO USE!
```

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Not Found" error when testing
**Cause:** Railway hasn't deployed yet
**Solution:** Wait 2-5 minutes after git push, try again

### "MSAL not installed"
**Cause:** Requirements not installed
**Solution:** This shouldn't happen - msal is in requirements.txt. Check Railway logs.

### "Environment variables not configured"
**Cause:** You haven't added Azure AD credentials yet
**Solution:** Complete Step 2 (Azure AD Setup) and Step 3 (Add variables)

### "Failed to authenticate with Microsoft"
**Cause:** Wrong credentials or missing permissions
**Solution:**
1. Check CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, TENANT_ID are correct
2. Verify admin consent was granted in Azure AD
3. Check client secret hasn't expired

### "Insufficient permissions"
**Cause:** API permissions not granted
**Solution:**
1. Go to Azure AD → App registrations → Your app
2. Click "API permissions"
3. Verify all 3 permissions have green checkmarks
4. Click "Grant admin consent" if not
